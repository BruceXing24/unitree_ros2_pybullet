<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="media/trotting.gif" alt="Image" width="50%">

This project mainly uses the unitree a1 robot for dynamics control to achieve a stable trotting gait.

There are four examples:
* pose with position control to verify kinematics
* torque control mode motor test
* balancing controller
* trotting gait

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
